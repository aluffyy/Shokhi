## Shokhi: Your AI Friend in Flutter (Material 3 Design)

**Shokhi** (meaning "friend" in Bangla) is a mobile application built with Flutter and utilizes the Gemini Pro API to provide users with an interactive and informative AI experience. Embracing a minimal Material 3 design pattern, Shokhi offers a clean and user-friendly interface for engaging with AI.

**Current Features:**

* **Conversational AI:** Interact with the integrated AI model through text messages, asking questions or prompting for creative text formats.

**Future Plans:**

* **Firebase Integration:** Integrate Firebase for user authentication and potential backend functionalities.
* **Multilingual Support:** (planned) Allow users to interact with Shokhi in various languages.
